                        <p>Solar energy is the energy produced directly by the sun and collected elsewhere, normally the Earth. The sun creates its energy through a thermonuclear process. The process creates heat and electromagnetic radiation. Only a very small fraction of the total radiation produced reaches the Earth. The radiation that does reach the Earth is the indirect source of nearly every type of energy used today.</p>
                        
                        <p>The exceptions are geothermal energy, and nuclear fission and fusion. Even fossil fuels owe their origins to the sun; they were once living plants and animals whose life was dependent upon the sun. Coming 21st century, we have come a long way in developing solar cells which are the devices powering our future, converting sun's energy into electricity.</p>
                        
                        <p>This work is about using non conventional energy i.e. solar energy for mobile battery charging. Solar chargers are simple, portable and ready to use devices which can be used by anyone especially in remote areas. Solar panels don't supply regulated voltage while batteries need so for charging. Hence, an external adjustable voltage regulator is used to have the desired constant voltage.</p>

                    <div class="section-content">
                        <p>The working principle of a solar mobile charger involves the utilization of solar panels to capture sunlight and convert it into electrical energy. These solar panels are composed of multiple solar cells that absorb sunlight and generate electricity. The generated electricity is then used to charge solar batteries, which serve as energy storage devices. In some cases, solar chargers may also include an onboard battery pack that can store surplus electricity for later use.</p>
                        
                        <p>The stored solar energy can be directly used to charge various handheld devices like phones and small electronic devices. For devices that require DC electricity, a charge inverter may be necessary to convert the electricity from direct current (DC) to alternating current (DC).</p>
                        
                        <p>Consumer solar battery chargers typically have smaller-sized and lower-power output solar panels compared to larger solar power systems. They effectively maintain battery charge and can even replace the self-discharge of unused batteries. This should have given you an idea about the working of a solar mobile charger.</p>

                        <p>To make sure we have plenty of energy in the future, it's up to all of us to use energy wisely. We must all conserve energy and use it efficiently. It's also up to those who will create the new energy technologies of the future. All energy sources have an impact on the environment. Concerns about the greenhouse effect and global warming, air pollution, and energy security have led to increasing interest and more development in renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, wave power and hydrogen.</p>
                        
                        <p>In solar mobile charger ripples will not be there as we use DC power directly to charge the mobile. Battery life is more as high voltages are not developed. Versatility of Solar mobile charger is high. Life of the battery will be high as we use solar mobile charger. Adaptability is high.</p>
